# The Simon Game

I will be building a game based on The Simon board game that creates tones and lights. The game requires the user to repeat the sequence, and will progressively become longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game will be over.

## Languages

I will be using HTML,CSS, and Javascript to build this game.
